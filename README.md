The Mental Health Expert System

Project Description:

This project is an intelligent computer expert system for a mental health clinic to diagnose mental disorders by using the AI methodology of backward chaining. After the disease has been diagnosed, the system will recommend a treatment by using the AI methodology of forward chaining.

How to Compile the Program:

To compile this project, you will need a C++ compiler like g++. You will need to navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command. This command will compile the main program along with BackChain.cpp and ForwardChain.cpp to link them into a single executable called main.

g++ main.cpp BackChain.cpp ForwardChain.cpp -o main

Once that's done, type this command to run the executable:

./main

The program will run and you can then follow the onscreen instructions to receive a diagnosis and a resulting treatment.
